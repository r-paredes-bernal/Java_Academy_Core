1) Change the computer order logic and change the order by id

2) Create a class Student with following attributes:

 - Name, Last Name, Location, Level
 
 3) Create a Test Class to test above class and print the results ordered by Name, Location and Level.
 Insights:
 - Use mock data for filling objects, at least 10. 
 - Use Comprable/Comparator to order the classes 
 - Use ToString to print the object attributes
 - May be, you will need to create different classes/interfaces for each ordering
 
 Homework:
 Figure out a way to only pass a comparator to the class to define the order of the objects
